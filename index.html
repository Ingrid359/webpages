        <p>
            Earth is the only planet in the Solar System confirmed to have life, and it is the only planet with a blue appearance. Additionally, Earth has the most suitable average temperature for supporting life, and it has oxygen and an atmosphere.

            A body needs to have enough initial velocity so that its speed balances with the gravitational force, allowing it to remain in a stable orbit. This balance is known as the "free-fall state," meaning the body is constantly being pulled toward the Earth by gravity, but due to its sufficiently high horizontal velocity, it avoids falling directly to the ground and instead orbits the Earth. When a spacecraft enters Earth's orbit, its trajectory is usually elliptical. An elliptical orbit has two important points: the perigee and the apogee. At perigee, the spacecraft is closest to Earth, where it experiences the strongest gravitational pull, so it needs to travel at a higher speed to counteract Earth's gravity and maintain its orbit. At apogee, the spacecraft is farthest from Earth, where the gravitational influence is weaker, and the spacecraft moves at its slowest speed. <br>
